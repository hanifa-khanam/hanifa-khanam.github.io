## 💡 Note on AI Assistance
While the portfolio is **designed and coded by me**, I leveraged AI tools for:

- Advanced CSS styling and responsiveness that I was unfamiliar with  
- Generating some JavaScript code for interactive elements  

My programming background in **Python and C++** helped me understand and adapt the AI suggestions effectively.

This approach allowed me to **learn new web development techniques** while building a professional portfolio.
